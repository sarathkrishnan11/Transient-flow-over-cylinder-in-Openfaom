# Transient-flow-over-cylinder-in-Openfaom
This case file sets up a 2D transient flow over a cylinder in Openfoam. 

This was primarily meant to work for airfoils and so, the meshing was done in 3D inorder to capture all the properties of the subject. and then it was cut into 2D for simulating the flow with Pimple Foam solver.
